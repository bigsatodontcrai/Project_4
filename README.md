## Project Overview ![Adventurer2](/Documentation/images/adventurer2.png)
For our EECS 448 project 3 we decided to create a platformer game. Similar to a Mario game. The goal of the game is to avoid enemies without losing all your health. This project, project 4, is a continuation of project 3. Project 4 differs from project 3, as we are adding more components and things for the player to interact with.

## Installation ![Adventurer4](Documentation/images/adventurer4.png)
